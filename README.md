# prolog-algorithm-w

Algorithm W for type inference written in Prolog.

This is a translation of the Haskell code found in
[Algorithm W Step by Step](https://github.com/wh5a/Algorithm-W-Step-By-Step)
into prolog. I can't guarentee that I translated this correctly (or that
Martin's haskell was correct, but I'm less worried about that).
